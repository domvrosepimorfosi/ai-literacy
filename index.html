                    <strong>AI Literacy</strong> is the broad, fundamental competency that students need in order to live, learn, and work in a world shaped by artificial intelligence. It is about much more than simply “using an AI tool.” It involves developing the <strong>critical mindset</strong> needed to understand, evaluate, and engage with AI systems responsibly –
                    especially when students use them to support their own work, not to replace it.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-text-dark">
                <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong> (sometimes called <strong>Prompt Literacy</strong>) is the specific skill set within AI Literacy focused on crafting clear, targeted prompts so that AI can offer useful <strong>suggestions, explanations, and models</strong>.
                In an educational context, this means teachers and students learn to ask for support (ideas, feedback, models) in a way that helps the student remain the <strong>main author and decision-maker</strong> in the task.

                Key Strategies: How to Master Prompting
            </h2>
            
            <p class="text-text-light mb-4">
                The strategies below can be used directly with students. The sample prompts are written in the first person so that
                learners can copy and adapt them when working with AI <strong>under teacher guidance</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-text-light mb-6">
                In every case, the goal is for the student to stay <strong>actively involved</strong> – planning, drafting, and revising –
                while the AI acts as a <strong>supporting tool</strong>, not a replacement for their own thinking and writing.

                        <p>
                            Ask the AI to adopt a specific persona or expertise (for example, “English teacher working with B1 students”)
                            and clearly define who you are and what you are trying to do as a student. Learners can introduce themselves
                            (“I am a B1-level student …”) so the AI tailors its explanations and tasks to their level.
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-semibold text-sm text-secondary">Why it works:</p>
                        <p>
                            Clearly defining the role and the audience narrows the model's focus, vocabulary, and tone, so the output is 
                            more appropriate for school work. It also helps the AI give explanations and follow-up tasks that the student
                            still has to think about, respond to, and build on – instead of receiving a “finished product.”

                            Be explicit about the required length, format, language level, and the kind of help you want. As a student,
                            you can ask the AI to give you an outline, a checklist, or feedback on your own writing – instead of asking it
                            to write the whole thing for you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            AI is powerful but needs structure. Constraints and clear instructions prevent generic, overlong answers and 
                            keep the AI in a <strong>support role</strong>. Students learn to define the task and use AI to improve
                            their own text, rather than to bypass the effort of writing.

                            Give the AI the necessary background information before asking for help: for example, paste a paragraph
                            you have written, the teacher’s task, or a model text. Then ask for feedback, suggestions, or questions
                            that help you improve your own work.

                            This allows the AI to “see” the student’s real level and the actual task. Instead of producing a generic
                            answer, the AI acts like a language coach, responding to authentic student writing and helping the learner
                            move from a first draft to a stronger version.

                            Use follow-up prompts to ask for changes, improvements, or clarifications. Your goal as a student is to
                            <strong>understand and control</strong> each change, not to accept everything automatically.

                            Iteration turns the AI into a partner in revision. Students practise reading critically, requesting targeted
                            improvements, and reflecting on why one version of a sentence or paragraph is better than another.
                            The AI becomes a tool for <strong>metacognition</strong>, not a shortcut.

                Why AI Literacy is Essential for Students
            </h2>
            <p class="text-text-light mb-6">
                The discussion around AI in education often focuses on the risks (cheating, loss of critical thinking),
                leading many to argue for restricting or avoiding its use. However, a strong counter-argument centers on
                the need to equip students with the <strong>essential competencies</strong> required for the 21st-century world.
                The goal is not for AI to “do the work,” but for students to learn how to <strong>stay in control</strong>
                of AI tools and to use them wisely.

                    <p>
                        The most compelling argument for promoting AI use is that it is rapidly becoming non-optional in professional settings.
                        AI tools are not just for coders; they are integral to marketing, finance, design, engineering, administration,
                        and education itself. Students who lack the skill to ethically and efficiently use AI for research, drafting,
                        and analysis will be at a severe <strong>competitive disadvantage</strong> in the job market.

                            <strong>Productivity and Efficiency:</strong> The ability to use AI to handle routine tasks
                            (for example, summarising long texts or checking grammar) allows students and professionals to 
                            dedicate more time to <strong>higher-order thinking</strong> and creative problem-solving.

                        <li>
                            <strong>AI as a Collaborator:</strong> The skill is shifting from “doing all the work yourself”
                            to <strong>“organising, supervising, and evaluating”</strong> the work – including what AI suggests.
                            Students therefore need to practise being the human in charge, not a passive recipient of AI output.

                        A fear exists that AI leads to reliance and degrades critical thinking. The reality is that learning
                        to manage AI can force a <em>new form</em> of critical thinking – if it is taught explicitly and used responsibly.

                            <strong>Verifying Outputs:</strong> Promoting AI literacy means teaching students to 
                            <strong>critically evaluate</strong> the source, accuracy, and tone of every output they receive,
                            as AI often “hallucinates” (produces false information). This transforms students from simple
                            consumers into active, critical readers.

                            <strong>Problem Formulation:</strong> Using AI effectively requires students to clearly define the
                            problem, the constraints, and the desired outcome. This need for clarity strengthens
                            <strong>logical and analytical skills</strong> and makes thinking visible.

                        Avoiding the promotion of AI literacy can unintentionally worsen existing societal inequalities.
                        By making AI literacy an explicit part of schooling, educators ensure that <strong>all students</strong>,
                        not only those with extra support at home, have the opportunity to practise responsible AI use.

                            <strong>Closing the Gap:</strong> Students in well-resourced environments will gain proficiency anyway.
                            Universal AI education ensures that all students are prepared for the future workplace and civic life.

                            non-judgmental tutor, providing immediate feedback on vocabulary and grammar. Used under teacher guidance,
                            this is a major <strong>equity boost</strong> for language learning.

                The question is no longer <em>if</em> students should use AI, but <em>how</em>. By actively teaching
                <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>, critical evaluation, and ethical guidelines, educators can help students
                keep their <strong>voice, agency, and responsibility</strong>, while transforming AI from a potential shortcut
                into a powerful tool for learning.

                Before students use AI systems to support their learning or to work on assignments, it helps to agree
                on a simple shared “pact”. For example, the following points can be discussed and adapted with each class:

                <li>
                    <strong>AI is a helper, not the author:</strong>
                    I use AI to get ideas, explanations, and feedback, but I still plan, write, and edit my own work.
                    I never copy and paste a whole AI answer and present it as if I wrote it myself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>I stay responsible for my work:</strong>
                    I check whether AI suggestions are correct, make sense, and match my teacher’s instructions.
                    If I use AI, I am ready to explain <em>how</em> it helped me and which parts of the text are my own.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>I follow safety and classroom rules:</strong>
                    I do not share personal data with AI tools, I do not ask them to create inappropriate content,
                    and I always follow my school’s and teacher’s guidelines on when and how AI can be used.
